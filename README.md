## Description

School assignment were I am learning to create a website from Design1-course with HTML, CSS & JS.

## Assignment Brief

For this course assignment, we were tasked with creating SquareEyes, our personalized prototype based on the previous course assignment. The objective was to develop a fully functional and visually appealing website using HTML, CSS, and JS. To meet the requirements, we had to ensure the code followed neat semantic practices, demonstrate responsiveness, and adhere to the CSS principles of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). When appropriate, we could incorporate Flexbox and Grid. Additionally, the website needed to be WCAG compliant, prioritizing accessibility. It's important to note that the use of frameworks was not permitted for this assignment.
