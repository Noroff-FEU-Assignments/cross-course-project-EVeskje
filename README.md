<h1>Square Eyes - cross-course assignment</h1>

School assignment were I am learning to create a website from Design1-course with HTML, CSS & JS.

<h2>Brief</h2>
In this course assignment we were given the task of developing SquareEyes, our own designed prototype from last course assignment. The site should be a functional, well presented website written with HTML, CSS & JS. There were several criteria to be met, such as neat semantic, responsiveness and CSS after the DRY principles. We could use Flexbox and Grid where appropriate, and the site should be WCAG compliant. Accessibility should be taken into account.
Framework is not allowed.
